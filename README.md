## Uploading a video.

1. Have a video that exists. You'll want this video uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) as a [Public or Unlisted video](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).

2. Create info for your extension, like a description and a banner / thumbnail.
The banner / thumbnail is not required, but it will be a solid color if not provided.

Your banner / thumbnail must also be MIT licensed (basically just make it yourself and the image should be usable anywhere)

3. Open [this link](https://github.com/PenguinMod/PenguinMod-ExtensionsGallery/tree/main/static/extensions) in a new tab to open the folder.

Click `Add File` at the top and click `Create new file`.

GitHub will likely tell you to make a fork to do this step. Make sure to create one as you'll need to have the files somewhere.

Create a new folder with your **Scratch** username. You can do this by typing the username as the file name, and then typing a `/`. Then type the actual file name, followed by `.js`.

Now, paste your extension's code into the file.
You should now be able to `Commit changes` or `Create a pull request`, it'll likely be a green button.

### Step 4.
Create the pull request.

Continue through the menus until it lets you create a pull request.

You can post your extension banner / thumbnail and or description in the pull request.

Once your pull request is merged, it'll be on the site. You may get responses about things you should change or fix though.
