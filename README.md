## Uploading a video.

1. Have a video that exists. You'll want this video uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) as a [Public or Unlisted video](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).

2. Add your extension in the videos folder.

Open [this link](https://github.com/PenguinMod/PenguinMod-ExtensionsGallery/tree/main/static/extensions) in a new tab to open the folder.

Click `Add File` at the top and click `Create new file`.

GitHub will likely tell you to make a fork to do this step. Make sure to create one as you'll need to have the files somewhere.

Create a new folder with your **Scratch** username. You can do this by typing the username as the file name, and then typing a `/`. Then type the actual file name, followed by `.js`.

Now, enter your video title into the file.
In the next line, you will paste a link to your YouTube video.
You should now be able to `Commit changes` or `Create a pull request`, it'll likely be a green button.

4. Create the pull request.

Continue through the menus until it lets you create a pull request.

Once your pull request is merged, it'll be available in the app.
